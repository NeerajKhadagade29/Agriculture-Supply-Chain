# Agriculture Supply Chain

I have completed my Post Graduate Program in Data Science from International School of Engineering (INSOFE) in the month of January 2020. 
As a part of the curriculum, there is a 3-week Project Hackathon and Defense (PHD) conducted.

The problem statement was to **predict the yield of crop, specifically 4 crops (named as ing_w, ing_x, ing_y and ing_z)** for the year 2017.

The datasets consisted of: 
  1. description of about 1400 farms (farm_data)
  2. everyday's weather data of 2016 (train_weather)
  3. daily yield of each ingredient from each farm for the year 2016 (train_data)
  
  
I would also like to mention that I had secured 1st position in this hackathon. Hope you like the notebook :)
